## Introduction
Abandonment of dogs are a growing concern in Korea. In fact, millions of dogs are abandoned around the world, which is both problematic in terms of animal welfare.  According to the <유실유기동물분석> report released by the Korean Animal Welfare Association, 38.8% of pure breed dogs in adoption centers were adopted in 2020, and 38.5% in 2021. However, out of these adopted dogs, 41.3% of adopted dogs were returned to adoption centers in 2020 and 45% in 2021.  In worse cases, dogs are abandoned, refueling the problem of stray dogs. Some people adopt dogs based on their physical appearance only, with limited considerations for the differences in specific traits of breeds.  Consequently, people choose breeds that are incompatible with their lifestyle, socioeconomic status, and home environment. For example, according to a news article from Press Kookmin, it states that the owners of dogs are unaware of the financial costs related to raising a dog, leading to have to give up ownership of their dog.  Thus, there is a growing need to improve transparency about the costs and the specific traits of dog breeds to guide people when adopting dogs. Based on data compiled from various sources, we designed a comprehensive recommendation system that helps users adopt a dog that is compatible with their needs. We hope to implement this system to help prevent dogs from being abandoned.
